# Machine Learning
## Definition

A subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions/ predictions without being explicitly programmed.
It enables computers to learn and make predictions/ decisions based on data rather than relying on code.

## Types of machine learning
**Supervised learning**

The model is trained on a labeled data set which means that the data includes input-output pairs. The goal is to learn mapping from inputs to outputs, so the model can predict the output for new, unseen data. Examples incclude classification (eg fraud detection, image classification, customer retention, dignostics) and regression (new insights, process optimization, forecasting, predictions)

**Unsupervised learning**

The model is trained on data without labeled responses. The goal is to identify patterns or structures within the data. Examples include dimensionality rreduction (structure discovery, meaningful comprehension, big data visualization) and clustering (recommended systems, targetted marketing, customer segmentation)

**Reinforcement learning**

The model learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment receiving rrewards or penaalties based on the actions it takes. Overtime it learns to maximize the cumulative reward. Examples include Real time decisions, Game AI, Learning tasks, Skill aquisition, Robot Navigation.

**Semi-supervised learning**

A combination of supervised and  unsupervised learning, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data.

**Deep learning**

A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data. It is particularly effective in tasks like Image Recognition, Neural Language and Speech Recognition.
