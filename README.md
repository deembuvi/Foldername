# Data Visualization
When dealing with a significant amount of data, the idea of visualization comes into relevance. **This allows us to create, study and share data in a graphical manner so that the viewer can understand complex information according to its relevance and priority.**
**Data visualization**- this is the graphical representation of information and data through use of visual elements such as charts, graphs and maps.**
## Importance of data visualization
1.**Faster action**- data visualization provides a very clear form of communication that allows organizations to interprete and act upon their information more rapidly.

2.**Communicate findings in a constructive way**- reports from data visualization make it possible to encapsulate complex information in a brief series.

3.**Understand connections between operations and results**- data visualization allows us to track connections between operations and overall business/organization performance.
   
4.**Embrace emerging trends**- by using data visualization for monitoring key indicators, organizations can easily spot market shifts and trends in varied and large data sets.

5.**Create new discussion**- data visualization provides a ready means to tell a story from the data. Heat maps can show the development f product performance over time in multiple geographic areas, making it easy to see those that are performing well or underperforming.


# Machine Learning
## Definition

A subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions/ predictions without being explicitly programmed.
It enables computers to learn and make predictions/ decisions based on data rather than relying on code.

## Types of machine learning
**Supervised learning**

The model is trained on a labeled data set which means that the data includes input-output pairs. The goal is to learn mapping from inputs to outputs, so the model can predict the output for new, unseen data. Examples incclude classification (eg fraud detection, image classification, customer retention, dignostics) and regression (new insights, process optimization, forecasting, predictions)

**Unsupervised learning**

The model is trained on data without labeled responses. The goal is to identify patterns or structures within the data. Examples include dimensionality rreduction (structure discovery, meaningful comprehension, big data visualization) and clustering (recommended systems, targetted marketing, customer segmentation)

**Reinforcement learning**

The model learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment receiving rrewards or penaalties based on the actions it takes. Overtime it learns to maximize the cumulative reward. Examples include Real time decisions, Game AI, Learning tasks, Skill aquisition, Robot Navigation.

**Semi-supervised learning**

A combination of supervised and  unsupervised learning, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data.

**Deep learning**

A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data. It is particularly effective in tasks like Image Recognition, Neural Language and Speech Recognition.
